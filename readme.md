# Game collection
[Collection](https://gaudrey.github.io/collection-project/)

## Objectives

* Create a page with cards.
* Use JS
* Use a CSS framework

## What did I use?

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* Bulma

## Explanation

I start to build the DOM in HTML before using JavaScript to generate the element of the webpage. I needed that base so I wouldn't forget an element or messed up my DOM.

## What can be improved?

As it is, the search bar doesn't work. The visual can be improves as well.
